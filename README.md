# help-me-code-snippets
Code snippets that come-in handy to speed up day-to-day work.

As a Data Enginner, I usually touch multiple code repos written in various languages. Work can be to build new service from scratch, add new features, bug fix and enhancements.
This repo is to keep some functions handy to avoid searching.

Feel free to use the code and contribute
